The team also discussed the use of a Chinese model for demo purposes and the need to use a better model in the future.\n* **Decisions:**\n + The team decided to use a web-based meeting agent as the first option for the next meeting.\n + The team agreed to document all experiments and results systematically.\n + The team decided to create different vectors for each user to prevent overlapping in the future.\n* **Action Items:**\n + Implement a lambda function to create memories and follow-up questions.\n + Integrate a simple web-based meeting agent that can answer questions for the meeting.\n + Use a better model for the LLM and experiment with different models.\n + Normalize transcripts to prevent hallucination and improve results.",
