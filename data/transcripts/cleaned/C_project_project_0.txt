At the very beginning of the presentation, at 00:00:00, the AI Evaluator briefly stated, "Boarded." Concurrently, the screen displayed the title slide for a project. The slide is titled "Agentic Patient Simulator," further described as "A Multi-User Agentic Medical Interview System." It highlights the technologies used in its construction: "Built with LangGraph, LangChain, Flask, and Vanilla Web." The presenter is identified as "Ashmit Verma(2024134)" from "IIT Delhi." The slide is marked as "Page 1 of 10." The screen also shows a UI with a "Transcript" area, a message input box, and a "Send" button. A prominent message within the transcript from an evaluator reads, "I am an evaluator. I'll be evaluating your presentation based on the project and task requirements. Please begin…" indicating the start of the evaluation process. A system notification at the bottom confirms that "projects.icapp.co.in is sharing your screen" and offers a "Stop sharing" option.

At 00:00:01, the presentation transitions from a title slide to a live demonstration of the "Agentic Patient Simulator" web application. No one spoke during this specific moment. The application, accessible via 'localhost:5500', presents a multi-panel user interface. The left panel, labeled "Sessions," allows for managing patient interactions, showing options like "+ New Patient" and a list of existing patients (Patient 1-4). The central panel is dedicated to the patient simulation itself, currently displaying a completed session for "Patient 4 - c0d40d3." The interaction shows a doctor prescribing "treatmentrest in dark," which the patient accepts, followed by a system confirmation of "Treatment accepted." The right-hand side of the screen provides crucial patient data. The "Patient Memory" section details symptoms such as "nausea," "light_sensitivity," "movement_worsens_headache," and "headache." Below this, "Diagnostic Confidence" displays a probabilistic diagnosis, with "Migraine - 80%" being the most likely, followed by "Flu - 11%" and "Food Poisoning - 9%." Both the patient interaction and diagnostic confidence sections are marked as "Session completed." A "Send" button is present, suggesting further interaction is possible. The bottom of the screen also shows a notification that "projects.icapp.co.in is sharing your screen," along with the current weather and date.

At 00:00:34, the presentation transitioned to a detailed slide titled "Agentic Patient Simulator." No one spoke during this specific moment. The slide, identified as page "1 / 10" of a "Minimalist Clean Gears Green Project Review Corporate Presentation," introduces the project as "A Multi-User Agentic Medical Interview System." It explicitly states that the system was "Built with LangGraph, LangChain, Flask, and Vanilla Web," and credits Ashmit Verma (2024134) from IIIT Delhi as the developer. The slide prominently features a screenshot of the application's user interface. This UI includes a "Sessions" panel on the left, allowing for the management of patient interactions with options like "+ New Patient," "Patient 1," and "Patient 2." The central part of the interface displays a chat interaction, showing a patient's acceptance of treatment ("Patient: Okay Doctor, I'll follow this treatment.") and a system confirmation ("System: Treatment accepted. Session completed."), along with a "Send" button. The right-hand panel provides critical patient information, including a "Patient Memory" section listing symptoms such as "✓ nausea," "✓ light_sensitivity," "✓ movement_ataxia_headache," and "✓ headache." Below this, a "Diagnostic Confidence" section presents potential diagnoses with their probabilities: "Flu - 17%," "Food Poisoning - 9%," and "Migraine - 80%." The slide also indicates that "System Architecture" will be discussed, as it appears as a heading at the bottom. The overall screen capture includes elements from the presenter's desktop environment, such as browser tabs, a file path, and the Windows taskbar.

At 00:00:36, the presentation displays a detailed "System Architecture" slide, which is page "2 / 10" of the "Minimalist Clean Gears Green Project Review Corporate Presentation." No one spoke during this moment. The slide illustrates the "Agentic Patient Simulator" system, highlighting "Key: Memory + Coherence." The architecture begins with a "Frontend" identified as the "Doctor Web Interface," implemented using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. This interface includes a "Chat Interface," "Session Switcher," "Patient Memory Panel," and "Diagnostic Confidence Visualization." User interactions from the frontend are sent as "HTTP Request (session_id, message)" to a "Flask Backend API." The backend API manages `/create_session` and `/chat` routes, performing "Session validation" and "Request routing" to safely validate `session_id` and direct requests. It is also responsible for "Load / Update state" and ensuring a "Deterministic response." The system utilizes a "Session Store" to map `session_id` to `patient_state`, which encompasses `symptoms_revealed`, `questions_asked`, and the current `stage` (e.g., `ready_for_diagnosis`), representing the "State/output." The core intelligence is provided by the "LangGraph Patient Agent," which functions as a state machine. Its nodes include "Question Handling," "Symptom Revelation," "Diagnosis Gate," and "Treatment Phase," with state transitions managed by `graph.invoke(state)`. The slide also introduces a "TreatmentAgent" that "Accepts treatment only after correct diagnosis" and an "EvaluatorAgent" responsible for "Rubric-based diagnosis validation," described as "Deterministic & explainable," and "used only when ready_for_diagnosis = true." The "Architecture Overview" section on the slide reiterates key design principles: the frontend sends user messages with a session ID, the backend validates and routes requests per session, each session maps to a unique LangGraph thread and dedicated LangGraph execution, patient behavior is driven by a state machine, the UI reflects the agent state in real time, and critically, there is "No global state. No shared memory." All patient behavior is explicitly stated to be deterministic, state-driven, and session-scoped.

At 00:00:42, the presentation displays a detailed "System Architecture" slide, which is page "2 / 10" of the "Minimalist Clean Gears Green Project Review Corporate Presentation." The slide outlines the Agentic Patient Simulator's components, starting with a "Doctor Web Interface" (Frontend) built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, featuring a Chat Interface, Session Switcher, Patient Memory Panel, and Diagnostic Confidence Visualization. User interactions are sent as "HTTP request (session_id, message)" to a "Flask Backend API." This API manages `/create_session` and `/chat` routes, performing "Session validation" and "Request routing" to validate `session_id` and ensure request state safety. It handles "Load / Update state" using a "Session Store" that maps `session_id` to `patient_state`, encompassing `symptoms_revealed`, `questions_asked`, `stage`, and `ready_for_diagnosis`. The system design emphasizes "No global state. No shared memory." The core logic is driven by a "LangGraph Patient Agent," functioning as a state machine with nodes for "Question Handling," "Symptom Revelation," "Diagnosis Gate," and "Treatment Phase," invoked via `graph.invoke(state)`. The slide highlights that "Each frontend session maps to a unique LangGraph thread" and "All patient behavior is deterministic, state-driven, and session scoped." Supporting agents include a "TreatmentAgent" that accepts treatment only after a correct diagnosis, and an "EvaluatorAgent" for rubric-based diagnosis validation, which is "Deterministic & explainable" and "Triggered only when ready_for_diagnosis == true." An "Architecture Overview" section summarizes the flow: Frontend sends user messages with a `session_id`, Backend validates and routes requests per session, each session maps to a dedicated LangGraph execution, patient behavior is driven by a state machine, and the UI reflects agent state in real time. From 00:00:44 to 00:00:49, the AI Evaluator noted that the patient's behavior is controlled using a LangGraph-based state machine and then, from 00:00:51 to 00:00:53, asked Ashmit Verma to elaborate. Ashmit Verma responded from 00:00:54 to 00:00:58, explaining that the LangGraph state machine is active in the backend, where each session is created, and then from 00:01:01 to 00:01:05, he offered to show this in the current or upcoming presentation slide.

At 00:01:05, the presentation displays a slide titled "Architecture Overview" and "Technologies & Tooling," which is page "2 / 10" of the "Minimalist Clean Gears Green Project Review Corporate Presentation." Ashmit Verma, speaking from 00:01:01 to 00:01:05, states, "what is happening is each session is created. Let me show you in the PPT." This utterance directly relates to the slide's explanation of session management. The architecture overview details how the Frontend sends user messages with a `session_id` to a Flask Backend API, which then validates and routes these requests, mapping each session to a unique LangGraph execution. The system emphasizes that "No global state. No shared memory. Each frontend session maps to a unique LangGraph thread. All patient behavior is deterministic, state-driven, and session-scoped." The "LangGraph Patient Agent" is structured with "State Machine Nodes" for Question Handling, Symptom Revelation, Diagnosis Gate, and Treatment Phase, orchestrated by a 'graph'. The "Session State" is explicitly defined by `session_id`, `patient_memory`, `current_state`, and `current_action`. Additionally, the slide introduces a "TreatmentAgent" that only accepts treatment after a correct diagnosis and an "EvaluatorAgent" that performs rubric-based, deterministic, and explainable diagnosis validation with real-time evaluation. The "Technologies & Tooling" section specifies the use of "HTML/CSS/Vanilla JavaScript" for the frontend, ensuring a lightweight, framework-free UI with full control over session switching and real-time updates.

At 00:01:06, Ashmit Verma explained that "in our system, each session is created," which aligns with the slide's content. The slide, titled "Live System Demonstration & Backend Evidence" and marked as "5 / 10" of the "Minimalist Clean Gears Green Project Review Corporate Presentation," visually demonstrates this concept through chat snippets. The first snippet shows a user initiating a conversation with `"I have a headache and a fever."`. The system, acting as an assistant, then asks for more details: `"Okay, I understand. Can you tell me more about your headache? Is it throbbing, dull, or sharp? Where is it located? Do you have any other symptoms?"`. The user responds with `"It's a throbbing headache on my temples. I also feel nauseous."`. The slide explicitly states that "Each user initializes a unique backend session and LangGraph thread," reinforcing Ashmit Verma's point about session creation. It also highlights that "Symptoms are revealed gradually and gated by medical relevance." A key process shown is the "LangGraph transition: Questioning -> Diagnosis Gate (ready_for_diagnosis = true)," indicating how the system progresses through its diagnostic states. The presence of "projects.icapp.co.in is sharing your screen." at the bottom suggests a live demonstration context.

At 00:01:08, Ashmit Verma elaborates on the system's session management, stating, "Like, in our system, each session is created" (00:01:06–00:01:10). He further explains that "what Landgraf is doing, it is transitioning the state of that session ID" (00:01:10–00:01:15), and mentions that he is actively "storing" this state (00:01:16–00:01:19). This explanation is visually supported by the current slide, titled "Live System Demonstration & Backend Evidence," which is page "5 / 10" of the "Minimalist Clean Gears Green Project Review Corporate Presentation." The slide presents a detailed conversational exchange with an `agentic_ai.py` in a terminal interface. The AI initiates the interaction by asking "What are you feeling?", to which the user responds, "I have a cough and a sore throat." The AI then systematically gathers more information through questions like "How long have you been feeling this way?" (user: "About three days."), "Do you have any other symptoms?" (user: "No, just the cough and sore throat."), "Have you had a fever?" (user: "No."), "Are you experiencing any body aches or fatigue?" (user: "A little tired, but nothing major."), and "Have you been around anyone who is sick recently?" (user: "Yes, my roommate had a cold last week."). Based on this information, the AI provides a diagnosis: "Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you might have a common cold or a mild upper respiratory infection." It then offers medical advice: "I recommend resting, staying hydrated, and over-the-counter medications for symptom relief. If your symptoms worsen or don't improve in a few days, please consider seeing a doctor." The conversation concludes with the user's "No, that's all. Thank you!" and the AI's "You're welcome. Take care!". The slide explicitly states, "Each user initializes a unique backend session and LangGraph thread," directly correlating with Ashmit Verma's point about session creation. Furthermore, the slide provides backend evidence in the form of JSON tool calls, such as `{"tool_calls": [ { "name": "get_symptoms", "arguments": { "symptoms": [ "cough", "sore throat" ] } } ] }` and `{"tool_calls": [ { "name": "get_symptoms", "arguments": { "symptoms": [ "fever", "body aches", "fatigue" ] } } ] }`. It clarifies that "Symptoms are revealed gradually and gated by medical relevance." The core LangGraph functionality is demonstrated by the "LangGraph transition: Questioning -> Diagnosis" which is activated by a "Gate (ready_for_diagnosis = true)," illustrating the state-driven progression of the agent based on collected medical information.

At 00:01:20, Ashmit Verma utters the word "some." The slide, titled "Minimalist Clean Gears Green Project Review Corporate Presentation" and focusing on the "Agentic Patient Simulator," is page "5 / 10" and presents a "Live System Demonstration & Backend Evidenc" (partially visible). The slide highlights several key features of the system: it "Prevents hallucinated symptoms," "Keeps patient responses medically consistent," "Allows transparent reasoning," "Makes evaluation explainable," and "Ensures fairness and consistency." The visual content includes two command-line interface (CLI) windows showcasing a live system demonstration. The first CLI window illustrates the creation of a new session via a `curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/create_session` command, which successfully returns a unique `session_id` ("7e515220-47ca-43c9-a71c-df13b83cb273") and `thread_id` ("1ef9a2e2-9a42-4207-9231-31b37239b491"). Following this, a series of `curl -X POST http://127.00.1:5000/chat` commands demonstrate a patient simulation. The initial message, "How are you feeling?", receives the reply "I've been feeling unusually tired lately," with the debug information showing `questions_asked: 1`, `ready_for_diagnosis: false`, `stage: 3`, and `symptoms_revealed: ["fatigue"]`. The conversation continues with the question "Any cough or breathing issues?", to which the simulated patient responds, "I hadn't thought about it earlier, but I do have a cough." This updates the debug information to `questions_asked: 2`, `symptoms_revealed: ["fatigue", "cough"]`, and `next_action: "continue_questioning"`. A subsequent question, "Have you been coughing lately?", elicits the reply "I've had a persistent cough for a few days," leading to `questions_asked: 3`, `ready_for_diagnosis: true`, `symptoms_revealed: ["fatigue", "cough", "persistent cough"]`, and `next_action: "allow_diagnosis"`. Explanatory text on the slide clarifies that "Each user initializes a unique backend session and LangGraph thread" and that "Symptoms are revealed gradually and gated by medical relevance." The screen also shows system details like "Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.20108.7962]" and a browser bar indicating "projects.icapp.co.in is sharing your screen."

At 00:01:21, the slide, titled "Minimalist Clean Gears Green Project Review Corporate Presentation" and focusing on "Live System Demonstration & Backend Evidenc," is displayed. Ashmit Verma explains from 00:01:22 to 00:01:33 that variables such as 'diagnosis,' 'symptoms,' and 'questions asked' are managed within the Flask backend. He elaborates that LangGraph is crucial for transitioning and updating the memory of each session (00:01:35–00:01:41), likening the Flask backend to a 'bucket' containing 'boxes' that LangGraph, acting as a 'man,' updates (00:01:43–00:01:54). The slide visually supports this by stating, "Each user initializes a unique backend session and LangGraph thread" and "Symptoms are revealed gradually and gated by medical relevance." It provides concrete examples of how the session state evolves: an initial state with a message "How are you feeling?" and empty `symptoms_revealed` and `diagnosis` arrays. Upon receiving the message "I have a cough," the `symptoms_revealed` array is updated to `["cough"]`. Subsequently, with the same message "I have a cough," the `diagnosis` field is updated to "Common Flu," illustrating the state-driven progression. Ashmit Verma concludes by stating that he will now explain the system architecture (00:01:57–00:02:00).

At 00:01:57, Ashmit Verma announces that he will now explain the system architecture, transitioning the discussion. The current slide, titled "Live System Demonstration & Backend Evidence" and marked as page 4/10 of the "Minimalist Clean Gears Green Project Review Corporate Presentation," visually supports this explanation by showcasing a detailed interaction with the system's backend. The slide displays command-line `curl` commands demonstrating how a user initiates a session and interacts with a patient simulator. First, a `curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/create_session` command is executed, successfully returning a unique `session_id` ("f515220-9fca-43cb-a1fc-0f412b83c2f9") and `thread_id` ("f1694bc2-9a41-4207-7251-31a1259e6a1"). Following this, a series of `curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/chat` commands illustrate a conversational flow. In the initial chat, the user asks "How are you feeling?", and the system replies "I've been feeling unusually tired lately." The debug output for this interaction shows `stage: 1` and identifies `"fatigue"` as a revealed symptom. The conversation progresses as the user's subsequent message, "I've been feeling unusually tired lately.", prompts the system to reply, "I've been feeling unusually tired lately, and I have a cough." The debug information for this step indicates `questions_asked: ["Are you experiencing any other symptoms?"]`, `stage: 2`, and `symptoms_revealed: ["fatigue"]`. A third interaction shows the user stating, "I've been feeling unusually tired lately, and I have a cough.", to which the system responds, "I've had a persistent cough for a few days." The debug details for this stage include `questions_asked: ["How long have you had the cough?"]`, `stage: 3`, and `symptoms_revealed: ["fatigue", "cough"]`. This sequence visually demonstrates the system's ability to gradually reveal symptoms and ask medically relevant follow-up questions. The slide explicitly states that "Each user initializes a unique backend session and LangGraph thread" and that "Symptoms are revealed gradually and gated by medical relevance," reinforcing the system's design for consistent and medically sound patient interactions.

At 00:01:57, Ashmit Verma initiated the explanation of the system architecture, transitioning the presentation to a detailed overview. The current slide, titled "Minimalist Clean Gears Green Project Review Corporate Presentation" and labeled as page 2 of 10, visually supports this explanation with an "Architecture Overview" diagram for an "Agentic Patient Simulator." Ashmit explained that each frontend session maps to a unique backend session object (00:02:00–00:02:04). He elaborated that the Flask backend session is responsible for holding all of the patient's state, including `symptoms_revealed`, `questions_asked`, and `stage`, and critically, "No global state. No shared memory" is maintained (00:02:09–00:02:16). The diagram illustrates this flow, showing a "Doctor Web Interface" (Frontend) built with HTML/CSS/Vanilla JavaScript, which includes a "Chat Interface," "Session Switcher," "Patient Memory Panel," "Diagnostic Confidence," and "Visualization." This Frontend sends an "HTTP Request (session_id, message)" to a "Flask Backend API." The API, with `/create_session` and `/chat` endpoints, handles "Session validation," "Request routing," safely validating `session_id` and routing requests, providing a "Deterministic response," and managing "Load/Update state." This backend then interacts with a "Session Store" where `session_id` is mapped to `patient_state`, which includes `symptoms_revealed`, `questions_asked`, `stage`, and `ready_for_diagnosis`. Ashmit further detailed that for every message, a "LangGraph Patient Agent" is invoked using `graph.invoke(state)` (00:02:17–00:02:25). This LangGraph agent contains "State Machine Nodes" for "Question Handling," "Symptom Revelation," "Diagnosis Gate," and "Treatment Phase." He emphasized that this design ensures "deterministic, state-driven behavior instead of prompt based randomness" (00:02:26–00:02:31). The slide reinforces these points, stating, "Each frontend session maps to a unique LangGraph Patient Agent" and "All patient behavior is deterministic, state-driven, and session-scoped." Ashmit concluded by highlighting that because the state is session-scoped, multiple users can interact simultaneously without any memory leakage or cross-user contamination (00:02:31–00:02:40). The overall "Architecture Overview" summary on the slide states that the "Frontend sends user messages with a session_id" and the "Backend validates and routes requests per session," ensuring "Reply + Memory + Confidence."

At 00:02:38–00:02:40, Ashmit Verma emphasizes the importance of preventing "cross user contamination." This statement directly relates to the system architecture presented on the slide, which is titled "System Architecture" and is part of a "Minimalist Clean Gears Green Project Review Corporate Presentation" (page 2/10) by Ashmit Verma (2024134) from IIIT Delhi. The slide details the architecture of an "Agentic Patient Simulator." It illustrates a "Doctor Web Interface" (Frontend) built with HTML/CSS/Vanilla JavaScript, which includes a "Chat Interface," "Session Switcher," "Patient Memory Panel," and "Diagnostic Confidence Visualization," along with "Reply + Memory + Confidence" features. This frontend communicates with a "Flask Backend API" via "HTTP Request (session_id, message)." The backend, with endpoints like "/create_session" and "/chat," is responsible for "Session validation" and "Request routing," ensuring that requests are safely routed based on the session ID and that responses are deterministic. It also handles loading and updating the state. A "Session Store" is used to map each `session_id` to a `patient_state`, which contains critical information such as `symptoms_revealed`, `questions_asked`, `stage`, and `ready_for_diagnosis`. The core logic is handled by a "LangGraph Patient Agent," which takes "State input" and operates through "State Machine Nodes" including "Question Handling," "Symptom Revelation," "Diagnosis Gate," and "Treatment Phase," invoked via `Graph invoke(state)`. A crucial architectural principle highlighted is that "Each frontend session maps to a unique LangGraph thread," and "All patient behavior is deterministic, state-driven, and session-scoped." This design, as Ashmit Verma's utterance implies, is key to preventing "cross user contamination" by ensuring that each patient's state and interaction history are isolated within their unique session. The "Architecture Overview" section reiterates that the frontend sends user messages with a `session_id` and the backend validates and routes requests per session. An "Evaluator Agent" is also part of the system. This aligns with previous discussions where Ashmit explained that each frontend session maps to a unique backend session object and that the Flask backend holds all of the patient's state with "No global state. No shared memory" (from 00:01:59).

At 00:02:42, Ashmit Verma briefly acknowledges the transition, saying "And yeah." He then begins to specify the technologies used, mentioning "HTML" (00:02:45-00:02:48). This aligns with the current slide, which is titled "Minimalist Clean Gears Green Project Review Corporate Presentation" (slide 2/10) and provides an "Architecture Overview" for an "Agentic Patient Simulator." The slide visually details the system's components and flow. The "Doctor Web Interface" (Frontend) is explicitly stated to be built with "HTML/CSS/Vanilla JavaScript" and includes features like a "Chat Interface," "Session Switcher," "Patient Memory Panel," and "Diagnostic Confidence Visualization," along with "Reply Memory Confidence." This frontend interacts with a "Flask Backend API" using "HTTP Request (session_id, messages)." The backend manages `create_session` and `chat` functionalities, ensuring "Session validation" and "Request routing" to validate `session_id` and safely route states, leading to "Deterministic response" and handling "Load/Update state." A "Session Store" is central, mapping `session_id` to `patient_state` (containing `symptoms_revealed`, `questions_asked`, `stage`, `ready_for_diagnosis`). This state feeds into the "LangGraph Patient Agent," which uses "State Machine Nodes" for "Question Handling," "Symptom Revelation," "Diagnosis Gate," and "Treatment Phase," invoked by `graph.invoke(state)`. Crucially, the slide emphasizes "No global state. No shared memory." and that "Each frontend session maps to a unique LangGraph thread," ensuring "All patient behavior is deterministic, state-driven, and session-scoped." The architecture also incorporates a "TreatmentAgent" that "Accepts treatment only after correct diagnosis" and an "EvaluatorAgent" for "Rubric-based diagnosis validation," which is "Deterministic & explainable" and "triggered only when ready_for_diagnosis == true." A summary list reiterates that the "Frontend sends user messages with a session_id," the "Backend validates and routes requests per session," "Each session maps to a dedicated LangGraph execution," "Patient behavior is driven by a state machine," and the "UI reflects agent state in real time." This detailed architecture explanation follows Ashmit Verma's previous emphasis on preventing "cross user contamination" (00:02:38–00:02:40) and his earlier explanation that each frontend session maps to a unique backend session object, with the Flask backend holding all patient state and no global or shared memory (00:02:00–00:02:16).

At 00:02:45–00:02:48, Ashmit Verma begins to detail the technologies used, specifically mentioning HTML. He continues at 00:02:49–00:02:52, adding that CSS and JavaScript were used for the front end. This aligns with the current presentation slide, which is titled "Minimalist Clean Gears Green Project Review Corporate Presentation" (slide 2/10) and is divided into "Architecture Overview" and "Technologies & Tooling." The "Architecture Overview" section describes the system's components and their interactions for an "Agentic Patient Simulator." It highlights a "Session Store" that manages `version_id - patient state`, encompassing `symptoms_revealed`, `questions_asked`, `diagnosis`, and `treatment_plan`, explicitly stating "No global state. No shared memory." The "LangGraph Patient Agent" is described with "State Machine Nodes" for "Question Handling," "Symptom Revelation," "Diagnosis, State," and "Treatment Phase," utilizing `graph-invocation`. Key architectural principles are outlined: "Each frontend session maps to a unique LangGraph thread" and "All patient behavior is deterministic, state-driven, and session-scoped." The overall flow involves the "Frontend sends user messages with a session_id," the "Backend validates and routes requests per session," "Each session maps to a dedicated LangGraph execution," "Patient behavior is driven by a state machine," and the "UI reflects agent state in real time." The slide also introduces a "TreatmentAgent" that "Accepts treatment only after correct diagnosis" and an "EvaluatorAgent" for "Rubric-based diagnosis validation," which is "Deterministic & explainable" and triggers "when ready for diagnosis = true." The "Technologies & Tooling" section, under "TechStack," specifies "HTML / CSS / Vanilla JavaScript" for the "Frontend," emphasizing its "Lightweight and framework-free UI," "Full control over session switching and real-time UI updates," and "No hidden abstractions during evaluation."

At 00:02:49–00:02:52, Ashmit Verma specifies that CSS and JavaScript were used for the front end, continuing his explanation of the project's technology stack. The current slide, titled "TechStack" (slide 3/10) from the "Minimalist Clean Gears Green Project Review Corporate Presentation," provides a detailed breakdown of the technologies. For the Frontend, it lists HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, emphasizing a "Lightweight and framework-free UI," "Full control over session switching and real-time UI updates," and "No hidden abstractions during evaluation." The Backend is built with Python and Flask, described as providing "Simple, explicit request routing," "Easy session validation and isolation," and being "Ideal for deterministic, state-driven APIs." The Agent Framework leverages LangGraph and LangChain. LangGraph is used to "Model patient behavior as a state machine," "Enforce stage-gated transitions (question -> diagnosis -> treatment)," and "Guarantee deterministic, session-scoped graph execution." LangChain is utilized for "controlled LLM interactions," separating "language understanding from decision logic," and avoiding "embedding reasoning inside prompts." For Data/State, an "In-memory session store" is implemented, which is "(session-scoped)," maps "session_id -> patient_state," has "No global memory," and "Enables true multi-user isolation." This aligns with previous discussions about preventing "cross user contamination" and ensuring session isolation.

At 00:02:49–00:02:52, Ashmit Verma specifies that CSS and JavaScript were used for the front end of the project. He continues from 00:02:52–00:03:00, explaining that he kept the front end simple to ensure a lightweight framework. For the backend, he utilized Python and Flask, and for the agent framework, he employed LangGraph. The current slide, titled "Technologies & Tooling" (slide 3/10) from the "Minimalist Clean Gears Green Project Review Corporate Presentation," visually supports this explanation by detailing the project's "TechStack." The Frontend section lists HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, highlighting features like a "Lightweight and framework-free UI," "Full control over session switching and real-time UI updates," and "No hidden abstractions during evaluation." The Backend section specifies Python and Flask (Flask Backend API), noting its "Simple, explicit request routing," "Easy session validation and isolation," and suitability for "deterministic, state-driven APIs." The Agent Framework section details LangGraph, which "Models patient behavior as a state machine," "Enforces stage-gated transitions (question -> diagnosis -> treatment)," and "Guarantees deterministic, session-scoped graph execution." It also includes LangChain, used for "controlled LLM interactions," to "Separate language understanding from decision logic," and to "Avoid embedding reasoning inside prompts." Ashmit Verma further explains from 00:03:00–00:03:06 that for data and state management, an in-memory session store was used because there isn't much data currently. He clarifies (00:03:09–00:03:16) that in future scopes, he plans to add a backend for data storage, but for the present (00:03:16–00:03:25), it's implemented as an in-memory session store to reduce the overall system's heaviness. The slide's "Data / State" section confirms the use of an "In-memory session store (session-scoped)" which "Maps session_id -> patient_state" and has "No global memory."

At 00:03:39, the presentation slide titled "Key Design Choices & Engineering Decisions" (slide 4/10) is displayed, detailing five core design principles for the Agentic Patient Simulator. These principles are: "Session-Scoped State (No Global Memory)" to ensure isolated patient states per user, preventing cross-user contamination and enabling reproducible, debuggable behavior; "Real-Time Confidence Visualization" for dynamic diagnostic confidence updates to make reasoning visible and avoid black-box decisions; "LangGraph for Control Flow, Not Prompts" which implements patient behavior as a state machine to enforce strict medical flow, prevent premature diagnosis, and guarantee deterministic execution; "Separation of Intent Classification and Symptom Revelation" to classify user questions before revealing symptoms, preventing hallucinations and ensuring medical consistency; and "Rubric-Based Diagnosis Evaluation" using a deterministic EvaluatorAgent for explainable, fair, and consistent diagnosis validation. During this time, from 00:03:38 to 00:03:49, the AI Evaluator asks Ashmit Verma to elaborate on how 'LangGraph invoke_state' achieves deterministic behavior, specifically contrasting it with prompt-based randomness. Ashmit Verma responds from 00:03:50 to 00:03:52, confirming that deterministic behavior is achieved. He further explains from 00:03:52 to 00:04:01 that this is done through specific rules and offers to demonstrate it by showing the 'diseases and treatments.PUI files'. This directly addresses the "LangGraph for Control Flow, Not Prompts" section on the slide, which states that LangGraph "Guarantees deterministic execution."

At 00:03:58, the presentation slide titled "Key Design Choices & Engineering Decisions" (slide 4/10) is displayed, detailing five core design principles for the Agentic Patient Simulator. These principles are: "Session-Scoped State (No Global Memory)" to ensure isolated patient states per user, preventing cross-user contamination and enabling reproducible, debuggable behavior; "LangGraph for Control Flow, Not Prompts" which implements patient behavior as a state machine to enforce strict medical flow, prevent premature diagnosis, and guarantee deterministic execution; "Real-Time Confidence Visualization" for dynamic diagnostic confidence updates to make reasoning visible and avoid black-box decisions; "Separation of Intent Classification and Symptom Revelation" to classify user questions before revealing symptoms, preventing hallucinations and ensuring medical consistency; and "Rubric-Based Diagnosis Evaluation" which validates diagnosis using a deterministic EvaluatorAgent, removing subjective LLM judgment, making evaluation explainable, and ensuring fairness and consistency. From 00:03:57–00:04:01, Ashmit Verma specifically mentions "diseases and treatments dot PUI files," likely referring to the implementation or storage of medical logic related to the LangGraph control flow or rubric-based evaluation.

At 00:03:59, the screen transitions to a Visual Studio Code interface, displaying the `disease.py` file from the `agentic-patient-simulator` project. From 00:03:57 to 00:04:01, Ashmit Verma states, "diseases and treatments dot PUI files," directly referencing the type of content now visible on screen. The `disease.py` file defines a Python dictionary named `diseases`, which structures medical conditions with their associated symptoms. For instance, "migraine" is defined with `"required_symptoms"` like "headache" and "nausea", and `"contained_symptoms"` such as "fatigue", "body ache", and "vomiting". Similarly, "allergies" lists `"required_symptoms"` including "headache", "light_sensitivity", "runny_nose", "swollen_mucous_membranes", "inflamed_bronchi", and "reddened_by_sunburn", along with `"contained_symptoms"` like "sneezing". "food_poisoning" includes `"required_symptoms"` of "nausea" and "vomiting", and `"contained_symptoms"` like "diarrhea" and "stomach pain". Each disease entry also has a `"min_patients"` field, currently set to 0. This code provides the foundational data for the patient simulator, likely used by the agents to understand and process medical conditions and symptoms.

At 00:04:01, the screen displays the `main.py` file in a Visual Studio Code editor, showing the core simulation logic for the 'agentic-patient-simulator' project. Ashmit Verma, speaking from 00:03:57 to 00:04:01, mentions "diseases and treatments dot PUI files," which refers to the content from the previous keyframe. He then continues from 00:04:01 to 00:04:03, stating, "Actually, what's happening is I have certainly," indicating he is about to explain the current context or an issue. The `main.py` file imports `os`, `json`, `typing`, and custom agents (`Agent`, `PatientAgent`, `DiagnosisAgent`, `EvaluationAgent`), `Graph`, and `utils`. The `run_simulation` function takes a `config` dictionary and initializes `patient_agent`, `diagnosis_agent`, `evaluation_agent`, and a `Graph` instance. It then runs a simulation loop for a configured number of steps. Within each step, it prints the step number, handles `patient_agent.interact(diagnosis_agent)` to get a `patient_response`, prints it, then `diagnosis_agent.process_patient_response(patient_response)` to get a `diagnosis_response`, prints it, and `evaluation_agent.evaluate(diagnosis_response, patient_agent.get_state())` to get an `evaluation_result`, which is also printed. The `graph` is updated with `graph.add_interaction(patient_agent.name, diagnosis_agent.name, patient_response, diagnosis_response)`. The loop checks `if evaluation_result["diagnosis_complete"]:` to print "Diagnosis complete!" and `break`. After the loop, `save_config` is called to store `final_diagnosis`, `patient_state`, and `graph_data` in `simulation_results.json`. The script concludes with a standard `if __name__ == "__main__":` block that loads `config.json` and executes `run_simulation(config)`.

At 00:04:02, the screen shows a Visual Studio Code editor displaying the `main.py` file of the `agentic-patient-simulator` project. Ashmit Verma, speaking from 00:04:01 to 00:04:03, states, "Actually, what's happening is I have certainly," and continues from 00:04:04 to 00:04:08 that he has "putted and constrained" the system. He clarifies from 00:04:08 to 00:04:14 that he has limited the system to only three diseases, rather than adding many. He explains from 00:04:14 to 00:04:21 that the observed deterministic behavior is a result of the specific symptoms and optional symptoms he has incorporated. From 00:04:22 to 00:04:28, Ashmit Verma specifies that these limited symptoms are defined and managed within the `diseasesandtreatments.py` file. He concludes from 00:04:28 to 00:04:35 that this setup ensures deterministic behavior, and "Landgraf is only ensuring the." The `main.py` file visible on screen reflects a sophisticated agentic architecture. It imports core Python modules like `os`, `json`, `typing`, and `dotenv`, alongside a comprehensive set of `langchain` components including `AgentExecutor`, `create_react_agent`, `PromptTemplate`, `ChatOpenAI`, `Tool`, `TavilySearchResults`, and `TavilySearchAPIWrapper`. Crucially, it integrates custom modules from the `agentic_patient_simulator` package, such as `AgentLLM`, `AgentMemory`, `AgentState`, `AgentClassifier`, `AgentPrompts` (from the `agent` subdirectory), `Graph` (from `graph`), and `Simulator` (from `simulator`). The `AgenticPatientSimulator` class is defined with an `__init__` method that loads configuration from `config.json`, initializes a `ChatOpenAI` language model, and then instantiates various agent components (`AgentLLM`, `AgentMemory`, `AgentState`, `AgentClassifier`, `AgentPrompts`) and a `Graph` object. These components are then passed to a `Simulator` instance, which orchestrates the patient simulation. The `_load_config` method handles JSON file loading, and the `run` method delegates the simulation execution to the `simulator` object. The script's entry point demonstrates how to create and run the simulator for a specific patient ID, "patient_1". The file explorer on the left shows a well-organized project structure with distinct directories for `agent`, `data`, `graph`, `memory`, `models`, `prompts`, and `simulator`, indicating a modular design. A system notification at the bottom prompts the user to install a Python extension, and the system clock shows 5:00 PM on December 27, 2025, with a weather forecast of 18°C and mostly sunny.

At 00:04:34, the screen shows a Visual Studio Code editor displaying the `diagnosis_agent.py` file, which is part of the `agentic-patient-simulator` project. Ashmit Verma, speaking from 00:04:32 to 00:04:35, explains that the system's "behavior" is such that "Landgraf is only ensuring the" and then from 00:04:36 to 00:04:37, he clarifies that it ensures the "symptoms from these files." This utterance directly relates to the code on screen, which defines the `DiagnosisAgent` class. This class, inheriting from `Agent`, is explicitly described in its initialization as being "responsible for diagnosing the patient's condition based on the provided symptoms and medical history." The `__init__` method configures this agent with `MemoryStrategy()`, `ModelStrategy()`, `PromptStrategy()`, and `UtilsStrategy()`, suggesting how it processes information and makes diagnostic decisions. The file explorer on the left panel shows the `backend` directory structure, including `agent`, `memory`, `model`, `prompt`, and `utils` subdirectories, from which these strategies are imported. The presence of `diagnosis_agent.py` and Ashmit's comments about symptoms and behavior reinforce the idea that this agent is central to how the system processes patient data for diagnosis, likely using the symptom definitions discussed in previous keyframes (e.g., `diseasesandtreatments.py`). A banner at the bottom indicates that "project.euapp.co.in is sharing your screen," and system details like "5:01 PM", "12/27/2023", and "18°C Mostly sunny" are visible.

At 00:04:37, the Visual Studio Code editor is open to the `diseases.py` file, which is part of the `agentic-patient-simulator` project. Ashmit Verma, speaking from 00:04:36 to 00:04:37, explains that the system derives "symptoms from these files." This directly relates to the content on screen, which defines a Python dictionary named "diseases". This dictionary structures medical conditions like "fever", "migraine", and "food_poisoning". Each disease entry specifies "required_symptoms" (e.g., "cough", "sore_throat" for fever; "headache" for migraine; "nausea", "vomiting" for food poisoning), "optional_symptoms" (e.g., "fatigue", "body_pain", "headache" for fever; "light_sensitivity", "nausea", etc., for migraine; "stomach_pain", "diarrhea" for food poisoning), and a "min_questions" parameter (e.g., 3 for fever and migraine, 2 for food poisoning). The file explorer sidebar on the left shows the project directory structure, with `diseases.py` located within the `data` folder. This visual context confirms Ashmit's previous statements (from 00:04:08 to 00:04:14 and 00:04:22 to 00:04:28) about constraining the system to a limited number of diseases and defining their symptoms in a specific file. A Google Meet overlay indicates screen sharing, and a VS Code notification prompts for the "Pylance" extension.

At 00:04:39, the screen displays a presentation slide titled "Minimalist Clean Gears Green Project Review Corporate Presentation" with the specific section "Key Design Choices & Engineering Decisions" indicated as slide 4 out of 10. The slide details five core design principles for the project. These principles are: 1) **Session-Scoped State (No Global Memory)**, which ensures that each user session maintains its own isolated patient state. The rationale provided is to prevent cross-user contamination, enable true multi-user support, and make the system's behavior reproducible and debuggable. 2) **Real-Time Confidence Visualization**, where diagnostic confidence dynamically updates as symptoms are revealed. This design choice aims to make the reasoning process visible, turn the agent into a teaching tool, and avoid black-box decision making. 3) **Separation of Intent Classification and Symptom Revelation**, meaning user questions are classified first, and symptoms are only revealed if they are valid. This prevents hallucinated symptoms, keeps patient responses medically consistent, and allows for transparent reasoning. 4) **LangGraph for Control Flow, Not Prompts**, where patient behavior is implemented as a LangGraph state machine. This approach enforces strict medical flow, prevents premature diagnosis, and guarantees deterministic execution. 5) **Rubric-Based Diagnosis Evaluation**, where diagnosis is validated using a deterministic EvaluatorAgent. The benefits highlighted are removing subjective LLM judgment, making evaluation explainable, and ensuring fairness and consistency. There were no utterances during this keyframe.

The overall context suggests a transition to demonstrating how patient data and symptoms are configured to influence the simulation's behavior.

At 00:04:58, the screen transitioned to a presentation slide titled "Key Design Choices & Engineering Decisions," which is page 4 out of 10. This slide details five key architectural principles for the Agentic Patient Simulator. Concurrently, from 00:04:53 to 00:04:59, the AI Evaluator asked Ashmit Verma to elaborate on how specific additions contribute to a more predictable simulation outcome. Ashmit Verma began his response at 00:04:59, saying, "So what the,". The slide content explains that "Session-Scoped State (No Global Memory)" is used to ensure each user session has an isolated patient state, preventing cross-user contamination, enabling true multi-user support, and making behavior reproducible and debuggable. "LangGraph for Control Flow, Not Prompts" is employed, implementing patient behavior as a LangGraph state machine to enforce strict medical flow, prevent premature diagnosis, and guarantee deterministic execution. The system also features "Real-Time Confidence Visualization," where diagnostic confidence updates dynamically as symptoms are revealed, making reasoning visible, turning the agent into a teaching tool, and avoiding black-box decision making. "Rubric-Based Diagnosis Evaluation" is used to validate diagnosis with a deterministic EvaluatorAgent, removing subjective LLM judgment, making evaluation explainable, and ensuring fairness and consistency. Finally, there is a "Separation of Intent Classification and Symptom Revelation," where user questions are classified first, and symptoms are revealed only if valid, to prevent hallucinated symptoms, keep patient responses medically consistent, and allow transparent reasoning. The slide also hints at a "Live System De" and "end Evidence" section.

At 00:05:00, the screen displays a web page from "projects.icapp.co.in" showcasing the "Agentic Patient Simulator" project. This project is identified as a "Multi-User Agentic Medical Interview System" developed by Ashmit Verma (2024134) from IIIT Delhi, built using technologies such as LangGraph, LangChain, Flask, and Vanilla Web. The user interface includes a left navigation panel with links for "Home," "My Application," "My Project Tasks," "My Course Tasks," and "Logout." An embedded image illustrates the simulator's user interface, featuring various input fields and a "Page 1 of 10" navigation, suggesting an interactive or multi-step process. A prominent "Transcript" section on the right displays a question directed at Ashmit Verma: "You mentioned adding 'Rich symptoms and opiates optional symptoms' to achieve deterministic behavior. Could you elaborate on how these specific additions ensure a more predictable outcome in the simulation?" Concurrently, from 00:04:59 to 00:05:05, Ashmit Verma began to explain, stating, "So what the, required symptoms are doing is required symptoms are the symptoms that are specifically". This utterance directly addresses the question visible in the transcript, indicating he is elaborating on how "required symptoms" contribute to deterministic behavior. The lower part of the page provides details about ICAPP Internships, Capstone Projects, and Apprenticeship Programs, emphasizing their role in providing hands-on experience and bridging the gap between academic knowledge and industry demands. A browser notification confirms that "projects.icapp.co.in is sharing your screen."

At 00:05:03, the screen displays a presentation slide titled "Key Design Choices & Engineering Decisions," which is page 4 out of 10 of a "Minimalist Clean Gears Green Project Review Corporate Presentation." Ashmit Verma explains that "required symptoms" are those specifically needed to diagnose a particular disease, while "optional symptoms" increase the confidence bar, which he plans to demonstrate later in the project (00:05:00-00:05:21). He then proceeds to explain the key design choices and engineering decisions detailed on the slide (00:05:21). The slide outlines five core principles: 1. **Session Scoped State (No Global Memory)**: Ashmit Verma elaborates that each user session maintains its own isolated patient state, ensuring no global state and that every request mutates only its session state (00:05:22-00:05:35). The slide further explains this prevents cross-user contamination, enables true multi-user support, and makes behavior reproducible and debuggable. 2. **LangGraph for Control Flow, Not Prompts**: Ashmit Verma states that the LLM cannot skip steps because transitions are enforced by the LangGraph (00:05:36-00:05:43). The slide clarifies that patient behavior is implemented as a LangGraph state machine to enforce strict medical flow, prevent premature diagnosis, and guarantee deterministic execution. 3. **Real-Time Confidence Visualization**: The slide indicates that diagnostic confidence updates dynamically as symptoms are revealed, making reasoning visible, turning the agent into a teaching tool, and avoiding black-box decision making. Ashmit Verma also mentions that design choice five allows users to see why the model leans towards a diagnosis (00:06:04-00:06:09). 4. **Separation of Intent Classification and Symptom Revelation**: Ashmit Verma explains that understanding a question does not automatically reveal a symptom (00:05:55-00:06:04). The slide adds that user questions are classified first, and symptoms are revealed only if valid, preventing hallucinated symptoms, keeping patient responses medically consistent, and allowing transparent reasoning. 5. **Rubric-Based Diagnosis Evaluation**: Ashmit Verma highlights that diagnosis correctness is checked against revealed evidence and not model confidence (00:05:44-00:05:53). The slide details that diagnosis is validated using a deterministic EvaluatorAgent, which removes subjective LLM judgment, makes evaluation explainable, and ensures fairness and consistency. Ashmit Verma concludes by mentioning the "Live system and demo," indicating that the "demonstrator is here" and referring to "back end evidence" (00:06:10-00:06:16). He also states that he created a session through a session ID and thread ID (00:06:18-00:06:22). The slide also shows a partial title "Live System De...end Evidence." The presentation is viewed in a web browser, with "projects.icapp.co.in is sharing your screen" visible.

At 00:06:19, the screen displays a presentation slide titled "Minimalist Clean Gears Green Project Review Corporate Presentation," which is page 4 of 10. Ashmit Verma explains that he created a session using a session ID and a thread ID (00:06:18-00:06:22), directly relating to the "Session-Scoped State (No Global Memory)" feature highlighted on the slide. This feature ensures that each user session maintains its own isolated patient state, preventing cross-user contamination, enabling true multi-user support, and making behavior reproducible and debuggable. The slide further details other key design choices for the Agentic Patient Simulator: "LangGraph for Control Flow, Not Prompts," which implements patient behavior as a LangGraph state machine to enforce strict medical flow, prevent premature diagnosis, and guarantee deterministic execution; "Real-Time Confidence Visualization," where diagnostic confidence updates dynamically as symptoms are revealed to make reasoning visible, turn the agent into a teaching tool, and avoid black-box decision making; "Rubric-Based Diagnosis Evaluation," which validates diagnosis using a deterministic EvaluatorAgent to remove subjective LLM judgment, make evaluation explainable, and ensure fairness and consistency; and "Separation of Intent Classification and Symptom Revelation," where user questions are classified first and symptoms are revealed only if valid, preventing hallucinated symptoms, keeping patient responses medically consistent, and allowing transparent reasoning. A screen sharing notification at the bottom confirms that "projects.icapp.co.in is sharing your screen."

At 00:06:21, the screen displays a presentation slide titled "Live System Demonstration & Backend Evidence," which is page 5 of 10 of the "Minimalist Clean Gears Green Project Review Corporate Presentation." Ashmit Verma states from 00:06:18 to 00:06:22 that he created a session using a session ID and a thread ID, which directly relates to the backend evidence being presented. The slide highlights the system's benefits under a "Why" section, emphasizing that it "Prevents hallucinated symptoms," "Keeps patient responses medically consistent," "Allows transparent reasoning," "Removes subjective LLM judgment," "Makes evaluation explainable," and "Ensures fairness and consistency." The visual content includes code-like snippets demonstrating a conversational flow, starting with a message "Hello! How are you feeling?" and a response "I'm feeling a bit under the weather. I have a cough and a sore throat." Further text explains that "Each user initializes a unique backend session and LangGraph thread," and "Symptoms are revealed gradually and gated by medical relevance." A key backend process is shown as a "LangGraph transition: Questioning -> Diagnosis Gate (ready_for_diagnosis = true)," indicating the system's progression towards diagnosis once sufficient information is gathered. The browser interface also shows elements like "Projects - Canva," "ICAPP Internships," and a file path "C:/Users/ASUS/Downloads/AGENTIC_CHATBOT.pdf," along with system information like the current time (5:02 PM) and date (12/27/2025).

At 00:06:22, the screen displays a presentation slide titled "Live System Demonstration & Backend Evidence," which is page 5 of 10 of the "Minimalist Clean Gears Green Project Review Corporate Presentation." Ashmit Verma explains from 00:06:18 to 00:06:22 that he created a session through a session ID and thread ID, which is visually supported by the `POST /api/v1/chat/sessions` request shown on the slide, including `Content-Type: application/json` and a `{"session_id": "6f7f8e9a-4b3c-4d5e-8f0a-1b2c3d4e5f6a"}` payload. He further elaborates from 00:06:23 to 00:06:28 that he asks specific questions, and symptoms are revealed gradually. The slide demonstrates this process with JSON examples: an initial patient message "How are you feeling?" results in `{"ready_for_diagnosis": false,"symptoms_revealed": []}`. When the patient states "I have a cough and shortness of breath," the system updates to `{"ready_for_diagnosis": false,"symptoms_revealed": ["cough", "shortness of breath"]}`. Adding "I've also had a fever for a few days" further updates the state to `{"ready_for_diagnosis": false,"symptoms_revealed": ["cough", "shortness of breath", "fever"]}`. The slide explicitly notes that "Each user initializes a unique backend session and LangGraph thread" and "Symptoms are revealed gradually and gated by medical relevance." It also shows a `LangGraph transition: Questioning -> Diagnosis Gate (ready_for_diagnosis = true)` and emphasizes that "Diagnosis is allowed only after sufficient evidence and validated deterministically." A "Testing" section is visible, along with a screen-sharing notification from "projects.icapp.co.in."

At 00:06:26, the screen displays a presentation slide titled "Live System Demonstration & Backend Evider," which is page 5 of 10 of the "Minimalist Clean Gears Green Project Review Corporate Presentation." Ashmit Verma explains that symptoms are revealed gradually (00:06:25-00:06:28). He highlights the diagnosis (00:06:30-00:06:31), which is only permitted after sufficient evidence has been gathered (00:06:31-00:06:34). He further clarifies that the LangGraph transition moves from questioning to a diagnosis gate when the system is `ready_for_diagnosis` (00:06:35-00:06:40). The slide visually supports this by showing API interactions for a diagnostic chatbot. The top-left code block demonstrates creating a session via `curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/create_session`, which returns a `session_id` ("7b132220-4f7c-41c9-a710-9f1204f3c973") and `thread_id` ("5ef3adc2-9287-9231-53b3d2070491"). An initial chat message "How are you feeling?" receives the reply "I've been feeling unusually tired lately.", with the system identifying "fatigue" as a `symptoms_revealed` at `stage: 1`, and `ready_for_diagnosis: false`. The slide text confirms, "Each user initializes a unique backend session and LangGraph". The bottom code block shows a subsequent interaction where the user states "I've got a cough.", leading to `stage: 2`, `symptoms_revealed` now including "fatigue" and "cough", and `ready_for_diagnosis: true`. The system then provides a `diagnosis: "Flu"` and asks, "Okay, I see. Do you have any other symptoms, like a sore throat or fever?". A partially visible section on the right confirms a `final_state` with `diagnosis: "Flu"`, `reason: "All required symptoms are present."` and `verdict: "Correct"`. The slide also explicitly states, "Symptoms are revealed gradually and gated by medical relevance."

At 00:06:38, the screen displays a slide titled "Minimalist Clean Gears Green Project Review Corporate Presentation," which details the system's interaction flow and internal state. Ashmit Verma explains from 00:06:35 to 00:06:40 that the "Landgraft tradition is questioning gate to ready ready for diagnosis," which directly corresponds to the on-screen text "LangGraph transition: Questioning" and "Gate (ready_for_diagnosis =." The slide presents a user query, "I am having a headache and a fever," and the assistant's follow-up question, "I understand. How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?" The system has successfully identified and stored `"symptoms_revealed": ["headache", "fever"]`. Crucially, the system's current state is `"ready_for_diagnosis": false,`, indicating it is not yet prepared to make a diagnosis. The slide also emphasizes that "Each user initializes a unique backend session and LangGraph thread" and that "Symptoms are revealed gradually and gated by medical relevance," ensuring a structured and medically sound diagnostic process before "Diagnosis is confirmed and validated."

At 00:06:40, the screen displays slide 5 of 10 from the "Minimalist Clean Gears Green Project Review Corporate Presentation," focusing on an "Agentic Patient Simulator." Ashmit Verma explains from 00:06:35 to 00:06:40 that the system has reached a "Landgraft tradition is questioning gate to ready ready for diagnosis," which is visually confirmed by the on-screen text "LangGraph transition: Questioning Gate (ready_for_diagnosis =." The slide's JSON-like content shows a "final_state" where "ready_for_diagnosis" is set to `true`, indicating the system is prepared for diagnosis. This state was reached after a series of "questions_asked" like "How are you feeling?", "Do you have a fever?", "Any cough or breathing issues?", and "Have you been coughing lately?", which elicited "last_answers" revealing "symptoms_revealed" including "fatigue," "fever," and "cough." An "evaluation" section confirms a "verdict": "correct" because "All required symptoms are present." Ashmit Verma then starts to introduce the "testing of my" (00:06:41-00:06:43), corresponding to the new "Testing" section on the slide, which includes categories for "Diseases," "Required Symptoms," "Optional Symptoms," and "Min. Questions Needed," outlining the criteria for diagnosis. The slide also reiterates that "Diagnosis is allowed only after sufficient evidence and validated deterministically."

At 00:06:41, Ashmit Verma introduces the "Testing" phase of his project, stating, "Here is the testing of my," as the screen transitions to slide 6 of 10 from the "Minimalist Clean Gears Green Project Review Corporate Presentation." The slide visually supports this by displaying a JSON object snippet showing `"ready_for_diagnosis": true,` and `"stage": 2,` with `"symptoms_revealed": ["fatigue", "fever", "cough"]`. A key principle for the system is stated: "Diagnosis is allowed only after sufficient evidence and validated deterministically." The slide further elaborates on the testing criteria through a table. This table outlines "Diseases" such as "FLU" and "Migraine," specifying their "Required Symptoms" (e.g., "Fever, Cough" for FLU, "Headache" for Migraine), "Optional Symptoms" (e.g., "Fatigue, Body Pain, Headache" for FLU, "Light Sensitivity, Nausea, Movement Worsens Headache, Unilateral Headache" for Migraine), and the "Min. Questions Needed" for diagnosis (3 for FLU, 2 for Migraine). This content demonstrates the deterministic validation process for diagnosis.

At 00:06:43, the screen displays slide "5 / 10" of the "Minimalist Clean Gears Green Project Review Corporate Presentation," focusing on the "Agentic Patient Simulator" and its diagnostic testing. Ashmit Verma, from 00:06:41 to 00:06:43, introduced this section by stating, "Here is the testing of my, model." He then pointed out from 00:06:44 to 00:06:45, "These are the diseases," and further elaborated from 00:06:46 to 00:06:57, "and these are the required system symptoms that I was talking about, the fever, cough, headache, nausea, vomiting. And these are the optional symptoms that increase the patient memory." The slide visually supports this by showing a detailed diagnostic process. A code-like block on the left illustrates a successful diagnosis: "diagnosis": "flu", with an "evaluation" confirming "reason": "all required symptoms are present", and "verdict": "correct". The system's "final_state" shows "ready_for_diagnosis": true, at "stage": 3, after having asked questions like "How are you feeling?", "Do you have a fever?", "Any cough or breathing issues?", and "Have you been coughing lately?". The patient's "last_answers" revealed "symptoms_revealed" including "fatigue", "fever", and "cough". On the right, the slide highlights the "LangGraph transition: Questioning" and a "Gate (ready_for_diagnosis =". A key principle is stated: "Diagnosis is allowed only after sufficient evidence and validated deterministically." Below this, a "Testing" section is introduced with headers for "Diseases," "Required Symptoms," "Optional Symptoms," and "Min. Questions Needed," setting the stage for a detailed discussion of how different diseases are evaluated based on symptoms.

At 00:06:49, the screen displays slide 5 of 10 from the "Minimalist Clean Gears Green Project Review Corporate Presentation," focusing on the "Testing" phase of the "Agentic Patient Simulator." Ashmit Verma, speaking from 00:06:46 to 00:06:57, highlights the "required system symptoms" like "fever, cough, headache, nausea, vomiting" and the "optional symptoms that increase the patient memory." The slide visually supports this by showing a code-like block indicating a "LangGraph transition: Questioning Gate" where the system is `ready_for_diagnosis: true` at `stage: 3`. It lists `questions_asked` including "How are you feeling?", "Do you have a fever?", "Any cough or breathing issues?", and "Have you been coughing lately?", which have led to `symptoms_revealed` such as "fatigue," "fever," and "cough." The slide also explicitly states, "Diagnosis is allowed only after sufficient evidence and validated deterministically." A table further details diagnostic criteria, with "FLU" requiring "Fever, Cough" and having "Fatigue, Body Pain, Headache" as optional symptoms, needing a minimum of 3 questions.

At 00:06:50, the screen displays slide "6 / 10" of the "Minimalist Clean Gears Green Project Review Corporate Presentation," focusing on the "Testing" phase of the "Agentic Patient Simulator." No utterances were made during this specific keyframe. The slide features a comprehensive table detailing diagnostic criteria for various diseases. The table is structured with columns for "Diseases," "Required Symptoms," "Optional Symptoms," and "Min. Questions Needed." It provides specific entries for FLU (Required: Fever, Cough; Optional: Fatigue, Body Pain, Headache; Min. Questions: 3), Migraine (Required: Headache; Optional: Light Sensitivity, Nausea, Movement Worsens Headache, Unilateral Headache, Relieved by Darkness; Min. Questions: 2), and Food Poisoning (Required: Nausea, Vomiting; Optional: Diarrhea, Stomach Pain; Min. Questions: 2). Crucially, the slide also explains the model's logic: "How this is used in the model:-" explicitly states that "Required symptoms → Must be revealed before diagnosis i."

At 00:06:52, the screen continues to display slide "6 / 10" of the "Minimalist Clean Gears Green Project Review Corporate Presentation," focusing on the "Testing" phase of the "Agentic Patient Simulator."

Crucially, the slide also explains the model's logic: "Required symptoms" "Must be revealed before diagnosis." This aligns with previous discussions by Ashmit Verma about "required system symptoms" and "optional symptoms that increase the patient memory" in the diagnostic process. The slide is presented within a browser window, indicating active screen sharing.

At 00:06:54, the screen displays slide "6 / 10" of the "Minimalist Clean Gears Green Project Review Corporate Presentation," which is part of the "Agentic Patient Simulator" project. Ashmit Verma, speaking from 00:06:46 to 00:06:57, highlights the "required system symptoms" like "fever, cough, headache, nausea, vomiting" and the "optional symptoms that increase the patient memory." The slide visually supports this explanation with a detailed table. This table categorizes diseases (FLU, Migraine, Food Poisoning) by their "Required Symptoms" (e.g., Fever, Cough for FLU; Headache for Migraine; Nausea, Vomiting for Food Poisoning), "Optional Symptoms" (e.g., Fatigue, Body Pain, Headache for FLU; Light Sensitivity, Nausea, Movement Worsens Headache, Unilateral Headache, Relieved by Darkness for Migraine; Diarrhea, Stomach Pain for Food Poisoning), and "Min. Questions Needed" (3 for FLU, 2 for Migraine, 2 for Food Poisoning). Furthermore, the slide explicitly details "How this is used in the model:-", stating that "Required symptoms" must be revealed before diagnosis, "Optional symptoms" increase the confidence score of a disease, and "Minimum questions" ensure progressive questioning. The presentation is viewed in a browser, with "projects.icapp.co.in is sharing your screen" visible at the bottom.

At 00:06:55, the screen displays slide "6 / 10" of the "Minimalist Clean Gears Green Project Review Corporate Presentation," titled "Testing," which is part of the "Agentic Patient Simulator" project. Ashmit Verma, speaking from 00:06:46 to 00:06:59, explains the "required system symptoms" like "fever, cough, headache, nausea, vomiting" and the "optional symptoms that increase the patient memory," clarifying that they "increase basically." The slide visually supports this by presenting a table that details "Diseases" (FLU, Migraine, Food Poisoning), their "Required Symptoms" (e.g., Fever, Cough for FLU; Headache for Migraine; Nausea, Vomiting for Food Poisoning), "Optional Symptoms" (e.g., Fatigue, Body Pain, Headache for FLU; Light Sensitivity, Nausea, Movement Worsens Headache, Unilateral Headache, Relieved by Darkness for Migraine; Diarrhea, Stomach Pain for Food Poisoning), and "Min. Questions Needed" (3 for FLU, 2 for Migraine, 2 for Food Poisoning). Below the table, the slide begins to explain "How this is used in the model:-", specifically stating that "Required symptoms" "→ Must be revealed before diagnosis i". However, unlike the previous keyframe, the detailed explanations for "Optional symptoms" and "Minimum questions" are no longer fully visible on the slide. The screen also shows open browser tabs for "Projects - Canva", "Minimalist Clean Gears Green", "Agentic Patient Simulator", and "ICAPP Internships", along with a notification that "projects.icapp.co.in is sharing your screen."

Questions Needed" (3 for FLU, 2 for Migraine, 2 for Food Poisoning). Ashmit Verma, speaking from 00:06:59 to 00:07:01, mentions "the confidence bar," which relates to the explanation on the slide about how symptoms are used in the model. Specifically, the slide states that "Required symptoms" must be revealed before diagnosis, and "Optional symptoms" increase the confidence score of a disease. The slide also shows a file path "File C:/Users/ASUS/Downloads/AGENTIC_CHATBOT.pdf" and a screen sharing notification from "projects.icapp.co.in" at the bottom.

At 00:07:02, the screen displays slide "5 / 10" of the "Minimalist Clean Gears Green Project Review Corporate Presentation," which is associated with the "Agentic Patient Simulator" project. The slide presents a detailed table outlining diagnostic criteria for various diseases. For FLU, the required symptoms are Fever and Cough, optional symptoms include Fatigue, Body Pain, and Headache, and a minimum of 3 questions are needed. For Migraine, Headache is required, with optional symptoms like Light Sensitivity, Nausea, Movement Worsens Headache, Unilateral Headache, and being Relieved by Darkness, requiring a minimum of 2 questions. Food Poisoning requires Nausea and Vomiting, with optional symptoms of Diarrhea and Stomach Pain, also needing a minimum of 2 questions. Ashmit Verma, speaking from 00:07:02 to 00:07:04, continues his explanation by stating, "Also, the minimum question needed to," referring to the "Minimum questions" section of the slide. This section further clarifies how the model uses this information: required symptoms must be revealed before diagnosis, optional symptoms increase the confidence score of a disease, and minimum questions ensure progressive questioning. A browser interface and a screen sharing notification from "projects.icapp.co.in" are also visible.

At 00:07:05, Ashmit Verma begins to discuss the process to "diagnose," further clarifying from 00:07:06 to 00:07:09 that this involves "which should be required symptoms, basically." This utterance coincides with a visual transition to a live demonstration of the "Agentic Patient Simulator" web application, accessible via `localhost:5500`. The demo interface is divided into three key sections. On the left, a "Sessions" panel lists various patients, with "Patient 4 cd8403d3" currently active, and an option to add a "+ New Patient." The central area displays a chat interaction where a "Doctor" has prescribed "treatment rest in dark," which the "Patient" has accepted, stating, "Okay doctor, I'll follow this treatment." The "System" then confirms "Treatment accepted. Session completed," indicating a completed interaction cycle. On the right, a "Patient Memory" section details the symptoms identified for the patient, including "✓ nausea," "✓ light_sensitivity," "✓ movement_worsens_headache," and "✓ headache." Directly below this, the "Diagnostic Confidence" section shows the system's assessment: "Flu - 11%," "Food Poisoning - 9%," and a high "Migraine - 80%." This high confidence for Migraine aligns with the listed symptoms, many of which were previously discussed as optional or required symptoms for Migraine in earlier slides. The demo visually illustrates how the system uses these symptoms to arrive at a diagnosis and suggest a treatment, directly following Ashmit Verma's explanation of required symptoms for diagnosis.

At 00:07:10, the screen transitions to slide "6 / 10" of the "Minimalist Clean Gears Green Project Review Corporate Presentation" for the "Agentic Patient Simulator" project. Ashmit Verma, speaking from 00:07:10 to 00:07:13, explains that these are special interaction test cases, such as greeting, and then mentions "your duration" from 00:07:14 to 00:07:15. He continues from 00:07:15 to 00:07:21, referring to ambiguity handling, specifically stating, "how many days have it been that I will show. Let me show you that too," indicating he is about to demonstrate or explain this further. The slide visually presents a detailed table outlining diagnostic criteria for various diseases. For FLU, the required symptoms are Fever and Cough, optional symptoms include Fatigue, Body Pain, and Headache, and a minimum of 3 questions are needed. For Migraine, Headache is required, with optional symptoms like Light Sensitivity, Nausea, Movement Worsens Headache, Unilateral Headache, and being Relieved by Darkness, requiring a minimum of 2 questions. Food Poisoning requires Nausea and Vomiting, with optional symptoms of Diarrhea and Stomach Pain, also needing a minimum of 2 questions. A section titled "How this is used in the model:-" further clarifies that required symptoms must be revealed before diagnosis, optional symptoms increase the confidence score of a disease, and minimum questions ensure progressive questioning. The screen also shows a browser interface with a "Stop sharing" button, indicating an active screen share from 'projects.icapp.co.in', along with system information.

At 00:07:19, the presentation displays slide 7 of 10, titled "Special Interaction Test Cases," within the "Minimalist Clean Gears Green Project Review Corporate Presentation" for the "Agentic Patient Simulator." Ashmit Verma, speaking from 00:07:15 to 00:07:21, explains that he will demonstrate "ambiguity handling," specifically mentioning "how many days have it been that I will show. Let me show you that too." He reinforces this intention from 00:07:23 to 00:07:24 by stating, "like, right now only." The slide visually supports this by presenting a table for test cases, with an example of "Greeting Normalization" showing a "User Input" of "Hello, how are you feeling?" and a "Patient State" of "Initial interaction, no symptoms disclosed." A partial second user input, "I'm not feeling well right now, please help me," is also visible. The slide also highlights key aspects of the model's dynamic updates, which include "symptom memory," "disease confidence bars," and "diagnosis permission," along with principles like "Minimum questions" and ensuring "progressive questioning." The screen also shows a notification that "projects.icapp.co.in is sharing your screen."

At 00:07:24, the screen displays slide 7/10 of the "Minimalist Clean Gears Green Project Review Corporate Presentation." Ashmit Verma, speaking from 00:07:23 to 00:07:24, states "like, right now only," which aligns with his earlier commitment to demonstrate ambiguity handling. The slide visually supports this by detailing specific interaction handling scenarios for an AI system. It covers "Greeting Normalization," showing how an initial interaction like "Hello, how are you feeling?" is handled when there are "Initial interaction, no symptoms disclosed," and also includes a user input of "I'm not feeling well right now, please help me." A new section, "Duration Ambiguity Handling," is introduced, illustrating how the system might ask "How many days has it been?" when faced with "Insufficient temporal context," and a user's response could be "It's hard to say right now." Furthermore, the slide presents "Treatment Validation," detailing the phase after "Diagnosis completed, treatment phase," with an example treatment "Treatment: rest in dark" and potential user feedback like "Okay, I will do that." (if relevant) or "I don't think this is related to m" (if irrelevant). The bottom of the screen also indicates that "projects.icapp.co.in is sharing your screen" and shows local environmental details including "18°C," "Mostly sunny," "5:03 PM," and "12/27/2025."

Ashmit Verma, speaking from 00:07:30 to 00:07:35, explains the interaction flow, stating, "So patient will be replying by this. Then I will ask for his symptoms." This utterance directly relates to the content of the "Testing" slide, which outlines the system's diagnostic logic based on symptoms. The slide presents a detailed table with three diseases: FLU, Migraine, and Food Poisoning. For each disease, it specifies the "Required Symptoms" (e.g., "Fever, Cough" for FLU, "Headache" for Migraine, "Nausea, Vomiting" for Food Poisoning), "Optional Symptoms" (e.g., "Fatigue, Body Pain, Headache" for FLU, "Light Sensitivity, Nausea, Movement Worsens Headache, Unilateral Headache, Relieved by Darkness" for Migraine, "Diarrhea, Stomach Pain" for Food Poisoning), and the "Min. Questions Needed" for diagnosis (3 for FLU, 2 for Migraine, and 2 for Food Poisoning). A critical instruction on the slide, under "How this is used in the model:-", states that "Required symptoms Must be revealed before diagnosis," emphasizing the necessity of core symptoms for the AI to make a diagnosis. The visual context also includes a screen sharing notification from "projects.icapp.co.in" and the Windows taskbar showing the date, time, and weather.

At 00:07:31, the presentation shifts to a live demonstration of the "Agentic Patient Simulator" web application, running on `localhost:5500`. Ashmit Verma, speaking from 00:07:30 to 00:07:35, explains the interaction, stating, "So patient will be replying by this. Then I will ask for his symptoms." This directly corresponds to the central panel of the demo, which shows a doctor-patient dialogue. In the displayed interaction, the doctor has already suggested "treatmentrest in dark," and the patient has accepted with "Okay doctor, I'll follow this treatment." The system confirms "Treatment accepted" and marks the "Session completed." The left panel of the simulator lists various patient sessions, with "Patient 4" currently selected. The right panel provides crucial diagnostic information: "Patient Memory" for "Patient 4 - cd8403d3" shows confirmed symptoms like nausea, light sensitivity, movement worsening headache, and headache, with the treatment already completed. The "Diagnostic Confidence" section reveals the simulator's assessment, indicating an 80% probability for Migraine, significantly higher than Flu (11%) or Food Poisoning (9%), confirming the diagnosis and the session's completion.

At 00:07:32, the live demonstration of the "Agentic Patient Simulator" web application continues, running on `localhost:5500`. Ashmit Verma, speaking from 00:07:30 to 00:07:35, explains the interaction flow, stating, "So patient will be replying by this. Then I will ask for his symptoms." This utterance aligns with the current state of the application, which has reset to an initial state. The interface is divided into three columns: the left column shows "Sessions" with a "+ New Patient" button; the central column, titled "Agentic Patient Simulator," displays "No session selected" and "Diagnosis not allowed yet," with an input field prompting "Create a patient to begin" and a "Send" button. The right column contains sections for "Patient Memory" and "Diagnostic Confidence." This setup indicates the system is ready for a new patient interaction, where Ashmit Verma intends to demonstrate the process of asking for symptoms and receiving patient replies.

At 00:07:38, the live demonstration of the "Agentic Patient Simulator" web application on `localhost:5500` shows a progression from the previous state. Ashmit Verma, speaking from 00:07:38 to 00:07:40, continues his explanation by stating, "which it says that." The application's interface is clearly visible, divided into three sections. The left panel, "Sessions," now shows "Patient 1" (ID 99862010) as the active session, along with a "+ New Patient" option. The central "Agentic Patient Simulator" panel has transitioned from an initial state to an active chat. It displays "Doctor: Hi" and indicates that the "Patient is typing," preparing for a response. An input field below the chat prompts the user to "Ask a question (e.g. Do you have fever?)" and includes a "Send" button. The right panel still contains "Patient Memory" and "Diagnostic Confidence" sections. The status "Diagnosis not allowed yet" remains visible. The screen also displays various contextual elements such as "Projects - Canva," "Minimalist Clean Gears Green," "ICAPP Internships," "A School," and a sharing notification from "projects.icapp.co.in."

Ashmit Verma, from 00:11:10 to 00:11:22, explains that once the treatment for the current patient (Patient 1) is completed, that specific session is stopped. He then indicates the intention to proceed to "patient two" to ask further questions, suggesting a continuation of the demonstration with a new patient scenario. The application's user interface is clearly structured into three distinct panels. The left-hand "Sessions" panel provides navigation options including "+ New Patient," "Patient 1," and "Patient 2." The central and most prominent panel, titled "Agentic Patient Simulator," showcases the ongoing chat interaction for "Patient 1 99862010." The chat log details the progression of the simulation, showing that the "Diagnosis completed — prescribe treatment" stage has been reached. The doctor's input, "Doctor: diagnosismigraine," is followed by the system's confirmation: "System: Verdict: CORRECT — Diagnosis matches and sufficient evidence was gathered." Subsequently, the doctor entered a treatment: "Doctor: treatmentrest in dark." An interactive input field is present at the bottom of this central panel, prompting the user to "Type diagnosis: flu / migraine / food_poisoning," alongside a "Send" button. The right-hand panel provides crucial diagnostic information, starting with "Patient Memory," which lists observed symptoms such as "nausea," "light_sensitivity," and "headache." Below this, the "Diagnostic Confidence" section quantifies the system's certainty for various diseases: "Flu - 13%," "Food Poisoning - 10%," and a high confidence of "Migraine - 77%." Other visible elements on the screen include various project-related text like "Projects - Canva," "Minimalist Clean Gears Green," "ICAPP Internships," and "A School," as well as a "Patient is typing" indicator and a notification that "projects.icapp.co.in is sharing your screen."

At 00:11:33, the "Agentic Patient Simulator" web application is displayed, running on `localhost:5500`. Ashmit Verma explains from 00:11:30 to 00:11:33 that he has implemented a random assignment mechanism within his `script.js` file. He elaborates from 00:11:33 to 00:11:39 that this functionality ensures each patient will be assigned a unique disease. The AI Evaluator, from 00:11:47 to 00:11:53, confirms understanding by asking if it's a "random disease" and not just a "different" one, referencing Ashmit's mention of assigning a random disease via `script.js`. The application's interface shows the "Sessions" panel on the left, with "Patient 2" currently selected. The central panel displays "Patient 2 - 93699320" and the status "Diagnosis not allowed yet," along with an input field "Ask a question (eg. Do you have fever?)" and a "Send" button, indicating the start of a new patient interaction. The right panel contains "Patient Memory" and "Diagnostic Confidence" sections. A browser notification "projects.icapp.co.in is sharing your screen." is visible at the bottom.

At 00:12:19, the "Agentic Patient Simulator" web application is actively displayed, showing an ongoing patient interaction for "Patient 2 - 33c93325". Ashmit Verma explains between 00:12:18 and 00:12:20 that the symptoms being discussed were indicative of flu, specifically mentioning fever and cough from 00:12:21 to 00:12:22. The application's central chat panel reflects this, showing a dialogue where the Doctor has inquired about "fever" and "headaches," to which the Patient has confirmed experiencing both. The right-hand "Patient Memory" panel has updated to include "✓ fever" and "✓ headache," while the "Diagnostic Confidence" section now displays probabilities: "Flu - 60%", "Food Poisoning - 0%", and "Migraine - 40%". This indicates the system is processing the patient's responses to update its diagnostic assessment. The interface also includes an input field for the Doctor to "Ask a question (e.g. Do you have fever?)" and a "Send" button, facilitating further interaction. The status "Diagnosis not allowed yet" is still present, suggesting the diagnostic process is ongoing.

At 00:12:25, the "Agentic Patient Simulator" web application is shown, operating on `localhost:5500`. No speakers were detected, and no utterances were assigned to this keyframe. The application's user interface is clearly divided into three main sections. On the left, the "Sessions" panel allows for navigation between patients, displaying "+ New Patient", "Patient 1", and "Patient 2". The central panel is dedicated to the ongoing interaction with "Patient 2", identified by the ID "33c93325". The status "Diagnosis not allowed yet" is displayed, indicating the diagnostic process is still underway. The chat conversation between the Doctor and Patient 2 has progressed, with the Patient confirming "Yes, I've had a fever." and "Yes, I've been having headaches." in response to the Doctor's questions. The Doctor has now posed a new question: "Do you have food poisoning?". The interface indicates "Patient is typing", suggesting Patient 2 is formulating a response. An input field labeled "Ask a question (e.g. Do you have fever?)" along with a "Send" button is available for the Doctor to continue the interaction. On the right side, the "Patient Memory" panel has recorded "✓ fever" and "✓ headache", reflecting the patient's confirmed symptoms. Below this, the "Diagnostic Confidence" panel provides a probabilistic assessment: "Flu - 60%", "Food Poisoning - 0%", and "Migraine - 40%", showing how the system's diagnostic probabilities are evolving with new information. A system notification at the bottom of the screen confirms that "projects.icapp.co.in is sharing your screen," with options to "Stop sharing" or "Hide" the notification. Additional minor UI elements like weather information ("18°C", "Mostly sunny"), a search bar, and the current time and date ("5:08 PM", "12/27/2025") are also present.

At 00:12:26, the "Agentic Patient Simulator" web application is displayed, showing an ongoing patient interaction. Ashmit Verma states between 00:12:33 and 00:12:36 that based on the current information, he can now diagnose the patient with flu. The application's interface is divided into three main sections: "Sessions" on the left, the main chat interface in the center, and "Patient Memory" and "Diagnostic Confidence" on the right. The central panel focuses on "Patient 2" (ID: 33c93325), with the status "Diagnosis not allowed yet" still present. The chat log shows the Patient confirming "Yes, I've been having headaches." and expressing general discomfort with "I'm just not feeling very well. Please help me !!" The Doctor's last question visible is "Do you have food poisoning?". The "Patient Memory" panel on the right confirms "✓ fever" and "✓ headache" as recorded symptoms. The "Diagnostic Confidence" section provides updated probabilities: "Flu - 60%," "Food Poisoning - 0%," and "Migraine - 40%." An input field at the bottom allows the user to "Ask a question (e.g. Do you have fever?)" and "Send" it. Browser-related elements like "Projects - Canva," "Minimalist Clean Gears Green," "ICAPP Internships," and "A School" are also visible on the screen.

At 00:12:34, the screen transitions to a code view, displaying a JSON-like structure that defines symptoms for a medical diagnosis. Ashmit Verma states between 00:12:33 and 00:12:36, "So now I can diagnose it with flu." The code on screen details "required_symptoms" as "cough", "fever", and "fatigue", and "optional_symptoms" as "headache", "light_sensitivity", "nausea", "vomiting", and "stiff_neck". This code likely represents the diagnostic criteria or a symptom profile for a specific illness, possibly flu, which aligns with Ashmit's utterance about being able to diagnose flu. The presence of these symptoms in the code suggests how the patient simulator determines a diagnosis.

At 00:12:38, the screen displays a Visual Studio Code editor, showing the `symptoms.py` file, which is part of the `agentic-patient-simulator` project. No speakers were detected, and no utterances were assigned to this keyframe. The `symptoms.py` file contains JSON-like data structures that define various medical conditions and their associated symptoms. Specifically, three conditions are detailed: 1. "symptoms": This entry defines `required_symptoms` as "fever" and "cough", and `optional_symptoms` as "fatigue", "body ache", and "headache". It also specifies `min_questions` as 0. 2. "migraine": This condition requires "headache" and has `optional_symptoms` including "light sensitivity", "nausea", "unilateral headache", and "visual disturbances", with `min_questions` set to 0. 3. "food_poisoning": This definition includes "nausea" and "vomiting" as `required_symptoms`, and "stomach pain" and "diarrhea" as `optional_symptoms`, also with `min_questions` as 0. The file explorer on the left shows the project structure, with `symptoms.py` located under `backend/data`. The VS Code interface also displays standard menu options ("File Edit Selection View Go Run Terminal Help"), a terminal panel ("Problems Output Debug Console Terminal"), and system notifications, including a prompt to install the Python extension and a screen sharing notification ("projects.icapp.co.in is sharing your screen."). The status bar indicates the current line and column (Ln 19, Col 18), encoding, and language. The system time is 5:08 PM on 12/27/2025.

At 00:12:39, the screen transitions to a live demonstration of the "Agentic Patient Simulator" web application, running on `localhost:5500`. The AI Evaluator explains from 00:12:39 to 00:12:50, "And now I will be showcasing what if my diagnosis is wrong. Like, if my diagnosis is your question. With my Please continue. And I'll do my best to help you understand the symptoms." This utterance sets the context for the demo, indicating a scenario where the system is guiding the doctor to gather more information when a diagnosis is uncertain or potentially incorrect. The application's UI is clearly visible, structured with "Sessions" on the left, the main "Agentic Patient Simulator" chat in the center, and "Patient Memory" and "Diagnostic Confidence" on the right. The central chat panel shows an interaction with "Patient 2" (ID: 33c93325). The patient has stated, "Yes, I've been having headaches." and expressed general distress with, "I'm just not feeling very well.Please help me!!" The Doctor has responded by asking, "Do you have food_poisoning?". The system currently displays "Diagnosis not allowed yet," suggesting that more information is needed before a definitive diagnosis can be made. The "Patient Memory" panel confirms that "fever" and "headache" have been recorded as symptoms. The "Diagnostic Confidence" section provides a probabilistic assessment: "Flu - 60%", "Food Poisoning - 0%", and "Migraine - 40%". This visual information directly supports the AI Evaluator's point about a potentially 'wrong' diagnosis or the need for further questioning to refine the diagnostic confidence.

At 00:12:44, the 'Agentic Patient Simulator' web application is actively demonstrated, running on `localhost:5500`. The AI Evaluator, speaking from 00:12:39 to 00:12:50, explains, 'And now I will be showcasing what if my diagnosis is wrong. Like, if my diagnosis is your question. With my Please continue. And I'll do my best to help you understand the symptoms.' This sets the context for the ongoing patient interaction shown on screen, where the system is guiding the diagnostic process when a diagnosis is uncertain. The UI is structured with 'Sessions' on the left, showing 'Patient 1' and 'Patient 2', with 'Patient 2' (ID: 33c93325) currently active. The central chat panel displays the conversation: the patient has reported 'headaches.' and expressed general discomfort, saying 'I'm just not feeling very well.Please help me !!'. The Doctor has asked two questions: 'Do you have food_poisoning?' and 'Do you have cough?'. The prompt 'Ask a question (e.g. Do you have fever?)' and 'Send' button are visible, along with 'Patient is typing', indicating an awaiting response. The right-hand panel shows 'Patient Memory' with 'fever' and 'headache' recorded, and 'Diagnostic Confidence' indicating 'Flu - 60%', 'Food Poisoning - 0%', and 'Migraine - 40%'. The 'Diagnosis not allowed yet' status for Patient 2 remains visible, reinforcing the need for further questioning as highlighted by the AI Evaluator.

At 00:12:45, the 'Agentic Patient Simulator' web application is actively being demonstrated, running on `localhost:5500`. The AI Evaluator, speaking from 00:12:39 to 00:12:50, sets the stage by explaining, "And now I will be showcasing what if my diagnosis is wrong. Like, if my diagnosis is your question. With my Please continue. And I'll do my best to help you understand the symptoms." Ashmit Verma then continues from 00:12:51 to 00:12:58, asking, "Like, if I do a diagnosis as, something else. So what will happen? Like, it will" and then from 00:12:59 to 00:13:06, clarifies, "show that verdict is verdict is incorrect. So I will now show the this is the error handling that I have done in my project." This indicates the current demo focuses on the system's response to an incorrect diagnosis or how it guides the user to a correct one. The UI shows 'Patient 2 33c93325' as the active patient. The central chat panel displays the ongoing interaction: the Doctor has asked, 'Do you have food_poisoning?' and 'Do you have cough?'. The Patient has responded with 'I'm just not feeling very well.Please help me!!' and confirmed, 'Yes, I've been coughing.'. Crucially, the system now displays 'Diagnosis can now be attempted' and prompts the user with 'Type diagnosis: flu / migraine / food_poisoning' and a 'Send' button. The 'Patient Memory' panel on the right has updated to include '✓ fever', '✓ headache', and '✓ cough'. Correspondingly, the 'Diagnostic Confidence' percentages have shifted to 'Flu - 71%', 'Food Poisoning - 0%', and 'Migraine - 29%', reflecting the new symptom information.

At 00:13:02, the "Agentic Patient Simulator" web application is being demonstrated, running on `localhost:5500`. Ashmit Verma, speaking from 00:12:59 to 00:13:06, explains that the system is designed to "show that verdict is verdict is incorrect" and that he is now demonstrating "the error handling that I have done in my project." This aligns with the on-screen content, which shows a scenario where the 'Doctor' has entered "diagnosis:migraine" in the chat, but the 'Diagnostic Confidence' panel on the right indicates a Flu confidence of 71% versus Migraine at 29%. The patient's symptoms listed in 'Patient Memory' include '✓ fever', '✓ headache', and '✓ cough'. The chat history shows the 'Patient' initially stating, "I'm just not feeling very well.Please help me !!", followed by the 'Doctor' asking, "Do you have cough?", and the 'Patient' confirming, "Yes, I've been coughing." The presence of "Patient is typing" suggests the patient is about to respond to the doctor's diagnosis or provide further information, potentially challenging the 'migraine' diagnosis given the higher confidence for 'Flu'. The UI also provides a prompt "Type diagnosis: flu / migraine / food_poisoning" for the user.

At 00:13:03, the "Agentic Patient Simulator" web application is actively being demonstrated. Ashmit Verma, speaking from 00:12:59 to 00:13:06, explains that the system is designed to "show that verdict is verdict is incorrect," highlighting this as a demonstration of the error handling he has implemented in his project. He elaborates, from 00:13:07 to 00:13:15, on the scenario where a doctor might wrongly diagnose a patient. The on-screen content directly illustrates this, showing a chat interaction where the 'Patient' confirms, "Yes, I've been coughing." The 'Doctor' then inputs "diagnosismigraine." The system immediately responds with "System: Verdict: INCORRECT — The symptoms do not match migraine," which aligns with Ashmit's explanation of error handling. The 'Patient Memory' panel on the right lists the patient's symptoms as "fever," "headache," and "cough." The 'Diagnostic Confidence' panel further supports the system's verdict by showing "Flu - 71%," "Food Poisoning - 0%," and "Migraine - 29%," indicating that migraine is a low-confidence diagnosis given the symptoms. Below the incorrect verdict, the system prompts the user to "Type diagnosis: flu / migraine / food_poisoning" with a 'Send' button, guiding them towards a more accurate diagnosis. Ashmit Verma then states, from 00:13:16 to 00:13:21, "Diagnosis flu. Now it shows that," likely indicating the next step in the demonstration. The AI Evaluator, from 00:13:30 to 00:13:34, acknowledges Ashmit's point, stating, "You mentioned that the system shows what verdict is incorrect."

At 00:13:34, the 'Agentic Patient Simulator' web application is being demonstrated, showcasing its diagnostic and error handling capabilities. The AI Evaluator, speaking from 00:13:30 to 00:13:34, noted that the system indicates when a diagnosis verdict is incorrect. Subsequently, from 00:13:34 to 00:13:42, the AI Evaluator posed a detailed question, asking for elaboration on how the system determines an incorrect diagnosis and the specific steps taken in its error handling process. On-screen, the central chat panel of the simulator illustrates this process. A previous 'Doctor' input of 'diagnosismigraine' resulted in a 'System: Verdict: INCORRECT — The symptoms do not match migraine.' Following this, the 'Doctor' has now entered 'diagosis:flu'. The system is currently in a state where 'Patient is typing', suggesting a response or further interaction is pending. The user is prompted to 'Type diagnosis: flu / migraine / food_poisoning' and 'Send'. The 'Patient Memory' panel clearly lists the patient's symptoms as '✓ fever', '✓ headache', and '✓ cough', which are critical for diagnosis. The 'Diagnostic Confidence' panel provides a probabilistic breakdown: 'Flu - 71%', 'Food Poisoning - 0%', and 'Migraine - 29%', reinforcing the system's internal assessment that aligns with the 'flu' diagnosis being more probable than 'migraine' given the symptoms.

At 00:13:35, the "Agentic Patient Simulator" web application is being demonstrated, showcasing its diagnostic and error handling capabilities. The AI Evaluator, from 00:13:34 to 00:13:42, posed a detailed question, asking for elaboration on how the system determines an incorrect diagnosis and the specific steps taken in its error handling process. This aligns with Ashmit Verma's previous explanations (from 00:12:59 to 00:13:06) about demonstrating the error handling he implemented, where the system shows an "incorrect" verdict for a wrong diagnosis. On-screen, the application's interface is visible, structured with "Sessions," "Patient Interaction," and "Patient Memory/Diagnostic Confidence" panels. The central "Patient Interaction" chat panel shows a previous system verdict: "INCORRECT — The symptoms do not match migraine," indicating a failed diagnosis attempt. Subsequently, the "Doctor" has entered "diagnosis:flu." The patient's message, "I'm just not feeling very well.Please help me !!", is displayed, and an input field is available for entering a diagnosis. The right-hand panel, "Patient Memory," lists the patient's symptoms as "✓ fever," "✓ headache," and "✓ cough." Below this, "Diagnostic Confidence" shows "Flu — 71%," "Food Poisoning — 0%," and "Migraine — 29%." Ashmit Verma began to speak at 00:13:49, stating "Of this is," likely in response to the AI Evaluator's question, before the utterance concluded.
