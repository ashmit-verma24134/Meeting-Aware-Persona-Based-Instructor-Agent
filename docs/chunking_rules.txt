Chunk Size:
Each transcript is split into chunks of approximately 300 tokens.
A hard upper limit of 350 tokens is enforced.

Chunk Overlap:
Each chunk overlaps with the next chunk by approximately 30 tokens
to preserve contextual continuity across boundaries.

Chunk Data Structure:
Each transcript chunk is stored with the following fields:

    - user_id
    - meeting_name
    - meeting_type
    - chunk_id
    - text

Field Definitions:
    user_id:
        Identifies which user the chunk belongs to.
        Used to enforce user-level isolation during retrieval.

    meeting_name:
        Identifies the specific meeting from which the chunk was extracted.
        Allows the system to automatically report the source meeting.

    meeting_type:   
        Indicates whether the chunk came from a live meeting or PPT evaluation.

    chunk_id:
        A unique identifier for the chunk within a meeting.
        Used for debugging and traceability.

    text:
        The actual transcript content of the chunk.

Chunk Constraints:

    - A chunk must always contain a user_id.
    - A chunk must belong to exactly one meeting.
    - Chunks from different meetings must never be merged.
    - Chunks from different users must never be merged.

Example Chunk:

{
  user_id: "ashmit",
  meeting_name: "ashmit_live_meeting",
  meeting_type: "live_meeting",
  chunk_id: 12,
  text: "Discussion about Phase-1 scope and chatbot requirements..."
}
