      "question": "what was the git pull thing that sir asked for to implement in project?",

      "question": "did sir agreed on normalizing the transcripts?",
      "answer": "No, Sir did not agree to normalizing the transcripts; when asked if a model could normalize them, he responded \u201cno\u201d and suggested using Gemini to remove noisy content instead.",

      "answer": "In the latest meeting the instructor confirmed that the first deliverable is a simple web\u2011based chatbot that can answer questions from meeting transcripts and will be ready by the end of January, with a clean UI.",

    {
      "question": "why sir asked not to use the chinese models like bg",
      "answer": "Sir warned against using the Chinese bg model because it is a low\u2011quality demo model that performs poorly compared with better\u2011documented alternatives, and he wants a more reliable model with solid research backing. He suggested finding a model with a good paper instead of relying on the sub\u2011optimal bg model. This ensures higher accuracy for the meeting\u2011assistant system.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How are follow-up questions handled in the system?",
      "answer": "Follow\u2011up questions are processed by referencing the prior question\u2019s context and ID, allowing the system to retrieve the relevant chunk of the meeting transcript and generate a detailed answer; a Lambda function will be added to manage this linking and to decide whether a new job (agent) is required for a different context. The conversation state, including user ID, date and time, is stored in files and a database so the follow\u2011up can be matched to the correct user\u2019s prior transcript. This enables continuous, context\u2011aware querying for each user\u2019s meeting record.",

    {
      "question": "Did Sir agree to building a separate transcript-normalization model?",
      "answer": "No, Sir did not agree to building a separate transcript\u2011normalization model; when asked about normalizing transcripts he suggested using Gemini to remove noisy parts rather than creating a new model.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What was the git pull example actually meant to illustrate?",
      "answer": "The instructor said he won\u2019t create a new model just to clean up transcripts. Instead, he suggested using Gemini\u2019s features to strip out noisy or irrelevant sections. So the approach is to rely on an existing tool rather than building a separate transcript\u2011normalization model.",

    },

      "question": "what tool?",
      "answer": "The tool being built is a simple web\u2011based meeting agent that uses chunked transcript embeddings to answer questions about the meeting.",
