The agent will be able to understand the meeting recordings and provide responses based on the transcriptions.",

One agent is responsible for giving the response, and the other agent is responsible for deciding whether to provide more context or not. This is paraphrased from the following text:\n\n\"ok either the previous answers or chunks previous answers and chunks do i need more information or not make it make it a proper system that i have so many things stored in the database i can retrieve based on the user id then keep asking questions and chat basically that thing should be the user the terminal layer should be very simple it should be something which you can take that backend piece and connect it to a slack bot also we will put slack bot in our meeting in our channel so backend we will host it and every time we will push have you made the repo? push it make me a collaborator and we will put a company also and they can also be a group they can also sit here let us get this working in a way for all our meetings yours, other guys whatever is there for these three groups where i am recording the meeting we are able to have on slack a conversation with the previous what is happening let us get a system working first by that time\"\n\nIn this context, the two agents are referred to as \"one is going to give the response\" and \"other guy is going to decide to give more context\".",

      "answer": "Based on the provided transcripts, it appears that deterministic behavior was being achieved in the pre-eval project through the use of a specific approach to handling user queries and meeting transcripts. In Meeting 3, Chunk 8, it is mentioned that the goal is to create a system that can answer follow-up questions based on previous conversations. The speaker suggests creating a lambda function that can take the previous question and use it to answer the follow-up question. In Meeting 3, Chunk 6, the speaker mentions that the current approach is to use a direct function to match user queries with stored transcript chunks.",

      "answer": "According to the transcript, the system rules for diagnosis are not explicitly stated. However, based on the conversation in Meeting 1 | Chunk 4, it appears that the system allows diagnosis when the user inputs symptoms and the system matches them with a disease. In Meeting 1 | Chunk 4, the user asks, \"What's the symptoms of flu?\" and the system responds, \"It was fever cough.\" The user then says, \"So now I can diagnose it with flu.\" This suggests that the system allows diagnosis when the user inputs symptoms that match a known disease. However, the system also appears to have error handling mechanisms in place to handle incorrect diagnoses.",

In Meeting 1, Chunk 4, it is mentioned that each patient would be having a random disease, and the symptoms of flu are discussed. However, there is no mention of the number of diseases supported in the system. In Meeting 1, Chunk 3, it is mentioned that the system is designed to diagnose diseases, but the specific number of diseases supported is not discussed.",
